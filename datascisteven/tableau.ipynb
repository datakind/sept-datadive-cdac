    "I have revised the NYC visualization to incorporate my most recent changes in dataframe. Still unsure about the headings in ACS database.  I implemented teamookla's method of joining the Ookla and FCC dataset.  It also involved having two geodataframes.  I went to the ookla folder to use a different cvs or zip file that was the type of geodataframe, but did not have the `tile` column.  I joined the dataframes using `geopandas.sjoin`, as per teamookla's notebook. I also implemented a fellow colleague's method of aggregating in task 1A.  The four visualizations are on a dashboard where you select which visualization is presented to the user, but I am brainstorming a more effective way of presenting the data.\n",
