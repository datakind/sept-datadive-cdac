### Research Questions 
1. Data representation: 
a. Align Ookla data at the census tract level for Florida.  
b. Map the FCC and Ookla datasets at the census tract level for one of the following states: California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Nevada, New York, Texas, Washington.
c. Add ACS data to the maps for each state. These will now include availability (FCC data) / performance ( Ookla data) / and access (ACS data) for each state. 

2. Data augmentation:
a. Conduct EDA on the New York City Permit Dataset. Where are street construction permits for fiber, 5G installation, repair or removal, spectrum communications taking place in the city?
b. What other cities (beyond Chicago and NYC) have similar open datasets for street construction permits related to Internet fiber?
c. What additional open data sets can you find that may be relevant to exploring construction for internet fiber or 5G?
