## September DataDive for University of Chicago CDAC 

Educational and economic opportunity, as well as health outcomes, depend on the availability of affordable, high-speed Internet access. The COVID-19 pandemic—and in particular society’s increasing reliance on reliable high-speed broadband Internet access during the crisis—has accelerated and magnified existing disparities. As the essential tasks of living move online, internet access is increasingly becoming an issue of economic opportunity.

### Research Questions 
1. Data representation: 

- a. Align Ookla data at the census tract level for Florida.  

- b. Map the FCC and Ookla datasets at the census tract level for one of the following states: California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Nevada, New York, Texas, Washington.

- c. Add ACS data to the maps for each state. These will now include availability (FCC data) / performance ( Ookla data) / and access (ACS data) for each state. 

2. Data augmentation:

- a. Conduct EDA on the New York City Permit Dataset. Where are street construction permits for fiber, 5G installation, repair or removal, spectrum communications taking place in the city?

- b. What other cities (beyond Chicago and NYC) have similar open datasets for street construction permits related to Internet fiber?

- c. What additional open data sets can you find that may be relevant to exploring construction for internet fiber or 5G?
